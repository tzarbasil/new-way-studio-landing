        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer, mobile or other devices by visiting a
            website and /or using live chat. They are common and widely used to assist in the way websites function
            alongside providing performance information to the company that operates, runs or owns the website.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Why do we use cookies</h2>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>
          <p>Pirate Studios uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website, gather website visitor data
            and allows us to optimise website content and marketing so that it is more relevant to you and your
            interests. Allowing us to create a cookie does not give us access to the rest of your computer, and does not
            allow us to see any personally identifiable data about you. Cookies in themselves do not identify you, just
            the computer or device you are using.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>﻿The information that we might collect from your device and store as cookies may include information about
            your device type, how your device has interacted with us, including the pages accessed and links clicked,
            how you navigate to and from our site and our content (such as which parts you click on and how long you
            spend on each page), your preferences, the services and/or products that you have viewed or searched for,
            website errors and response times.</p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>What type of cookies do we use?</h2>
        <h3>STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h3>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are
            usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting
            your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you
            about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work as expected. These cookies do not store
            any personally identifiable information.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>PERFORMANCE COOKIES</h3>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of
            our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around
            the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow
            these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its
            performance.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>FUNCTIONAL COOKIES</h3>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by
            us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies
            then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>TARGETING COOKIES</h3>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies
            to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store
            directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you
            do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Unclassified</h3>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>These cookies are still in the classification process. They will show up in one on the following
            categories; Necessary, Performance, Functional or Advertising.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How can I switch off or remove cookies?</h2>
        <div class="cfEa3L">
          <p>You can choose to opt out of all but the necessary cookies. In the settings of the browser, you can change
            the settings to ensure that cookies will be blocked. Most browsers provide you with an explanation on how to
            do this in the so-called ‘help-function’. However, if you block the cookies, it is possible that you will
            not be able to enjoy all the technical features our website has to offer and it may negatively affect your
            user experience.</p>
